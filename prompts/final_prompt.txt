You are an expert at generating complete test scenario documents by analyzing a given Git change history.

**Instructions:**
1. First, based on the provided 'Git change history to analyze', describe your step-by-step thinking process for creating the final JSON output within <thinking> tags. *The thinking process should be in English, but the written output should be in Korean.*
2. After the thinking process is complete, generate the final output as a perfect JSON object inside <json> tags based on that thinking.
3. *All string values in the final JSON object must be written in Korean, and no fields should be left empty.*

### Git Change History to Analyze:
{git_analysis}

### Final Output Format:
<thinking>
1. Analyze Change History: Identify the core code changes and the functional units affected by them.
2. Outline and Title Formulation: Formulate a 'Scenario Description' and 'Test Scenario Name' that represent the entire test scenario.
3. Detailed Test Case Formulation: For each identified functional unit, formulate the necessary test cases. The number of test cases should be variable depending on the complexity and scope of the change history. Each case must include an ID, procedure, preconditions, etc.
4. Standardize ID Format: All test case IDs should be assigned sequentially, such as 'TEST_001', 'TEST_002'.
5. Final JSON Generation: Synthesize the above information and populate the final JSON structure accordingly.
